<h1>Best movie series according to Rafael</h1>
<h2>A list of my top 3 movie series of all time</h2>
<hr />
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Peter Jackson)</h3>
        <p>This trilogy has a strong storyline, characters and is packed full of action and drama that made me feel engaged from start to finish.<br />
            <br />
            In order of my own preference:<br />
            1) The Return of the King<br />
            2) The Fellowship of the Ring<br />
            3) The Two Towers<br />
        </p>
    <h3>Star Wars Original Trilogy (Eps. IV-VI)</h3>
        <p>A Sci-Fi film series that revolutionised the application of CGI in cinematography with well-written characters, intra-galactic adventure, plot twists and drama.<br />
            <br />
            In order of my own preference:<br />
            1) Episode VI: Return of the Jedi <br />
            2) Episode IV: A New Hope <br />
            3) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back <br />
        </p>
    <h3>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phases 1-3</h3>
        <p>The most ambitious movie crossover project ever attempted (and more than successfully executed!), the movies in the MCU bring several heroes and villains of the Marvel comics to life with a strong focus on action, emotional engagement and portrayal of characters in their own unique ways on the big screen. <br />
            <br />
            Full Disclaimer:<br />
            There are far too many movies for me to even consider listing in order of preference here. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br />
